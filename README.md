### Helo there ðŸ‘‹

I am oct0ling! :octopus: 

I am a 19 years-old lad from a small town in Milan, Italy. :it:

I love reverse-engineering anything, from legitimate software to malware, hardware and even Windows internals. Mainly to cheat on multiplayer games- learn something new :innocent:

My coding expertise mainly focuses on offensive security and anything low-level.

My main programming languages are:
- x86 assembly
- C/C++
- A bit of C#
- Python mainly for web scraping
- Golang for API development

I also really like nintendo games. You can guess which two are my favourites :wink:
